## How to Run the Tests

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure Node.js and npm are installed. Then, install Cypress:
```npm install```

If Cypress is not yet installed:
```npm install cypress```

### 2. Open Cypress Test Runner (GUI)
```npx cypress open```
Then select E2E Testing, choose your browser, and run simple_calculator.cy.js.

### 3. Run Tests in Headless Mode (CLI)
```npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/simple_calculator.cy.js"```

This runs the test in headless mode using Electron (default), or you can specify a browser:
```npx cypress run --browser chrome```
